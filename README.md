# Distributed scheduler

Welcome to the Distributed Scheduler repository!
This system, consisting of a Management API üõ†Ô∏è and a Runner service üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, allows you to easily schedule and manage jobs
that execute at specified times in the future.

## Features

- **Job Scheduling**: Schedule jobs to run at specific times in the future.
    - **One-Time and Recurring Jobs**: Schedule jobs to run once or on a recurring basis.
    - **Cron Syntax**: Use cron syntax to schedule recurring jobs.
    - **HTTP or AMQP Jobs**: Send messages to an HTTP endpoint or an AMQP queue.
- **Job Management**: View, update, and delete jobs.

## Roadmap

- [ ] **Limit number of job executions**: Limit the number of times a job can be executed.
- [ ] **Job Dependencies**: Allow jobs to depend on other jobs.
- [ ] **Job Priorities**: Allow jobs to be assigned priorities.
- [ ] **Job Retries**: Allow jobs to be retried if they fail.
- [ ]  **Job callbacks**: Allow jobs to call a specified endpoint after completion.
