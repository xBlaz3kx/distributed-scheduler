# Observability

Scheduler currently supports logging and metrics. Both are exported via the OpenTelemetry protocol (GRPC) and can be
collected by any OpenTelemetry-compatible collector.

## Logging

Logging can be configured via the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable. The following levels are supported:

- `debug`
- `info`
- `warn`
- `error`

Metrics can be enabled by setting the `METRICS_ENABLED` environment variable to `true`. Metrics are exported via the
OpenTelemetry protocol (GRPC).

- `http_requests_total`: The total number of HTTP requests received by the server.
- `http_request_duration_seconds`: The duration of HTTP requests in seconds.

The following runner metrics are currently exported:

- `scheduler_jobs_total`: The total number of jobs that have been scheduled.
- `scheduler_jobs_failed_total`: The total number of jobs that have failed.
